# CaveAdventure

## Requirement
Your assignment is to write a program to help rid the Village of Programming Gods and Goddesses from the evil goblins of the Northern Caves. They are in great need of your help so please take on this challenge.

To get rid of the goblins you must perform three adventures which will grant you access to your ultimate destination, the depths of the cave where you need to complete your final mission.

These will not be easy tasks as in each one of the access ways lies in wait an evil monster that must be killed in order for you to gain access to the next level. However, the goblins are smart and they want to trick you, so in each access way they have hidden a treasure. If you try to access the next level without the treasure, you will be killed and have to start all over again. Therefore, you cannot leave an access way without first grabbing the treasure or you will fail in your mission. If, however, you find the treasure before slaying the evil monster, you can take a much needed snooze before moving on to slay the monster. Whilst you are snoozing, you will dream and in your dream sing “Old MacDonald had a farm”. On this farm you will find {cows, sheep, pigs and chickens}. However, the order in which you dream about them will vary each time you sleep.

Easy you think? Well, there is a catch. In one of the access ways (and we don’t know which one), there is a pretend second treasure. The goblins will try to trick you to think you still need to find it, and if you go for it, then you will be forced to perform a penance before moving on.

Once you enter the depths of the cave, slay the monster and gain the last of the three treasures, you can compete your final mission which is (drum roll please...) to generate a poem. You see at the heart of each God is a special word and, you must ask them to each give you their special word. Although we can assume that there are no more than 100 gods, we don’t know exactly how many there are, so you must continue to ask until there are no more villagers. Once all the villagers have each entered their special word, the program will generate a random poem of all the words entered. Upon this poem being displayed, the Village of Programming Gods will be
freed of the goblins and the world will be a safe place again. However, as each god is unique
all the words must be unique or else the goblins will come back to destroy the Village. This would not be good because the world is in desperate need of these programming gods and goddesses!
